1. Which other xv6 system call(s) could be made faster using this shared page? Explain how.

(1)read and write System Calls:
The read and write system calls involve copying data between user space and kernel space. 
Typically, data is copied from a user-space buffer to a kernel-space buffer (or vice versa).
With a shared page, the data could potentially be accessed directly,
eliminating the need for data copying and thereby speeding up these system calls. 

(2)fork System Call:
The fork system call creates a new process by copying the entire memory space of the current process.
A shared page mechanism could potentially optimize this process by allowing shared memory between 
the parent and child processes, thus reducing the amount of memory that needs to be copied.

(3)exec System Call:
The exec system call loads a new program into a process's memory space. 
If the program data could be mapped into a shared page, it might reduce the amount of data copying 
required to load the program, thereby speeding up the exec system call.

2. Explain the output of vmprint in terms of Fig 3-4 from the text. What does page 0 contain? 
What is in page 2? When running in user mode, could the process read/write the memory mapped by page 1? 
What does the third to last page contain?
The R(readable), W(writable), and X(executable) tag bits of a PTE 
that points to the next page table are all zero
